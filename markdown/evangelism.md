__January 2015__

Since joining [Appcelerator](https://www.appcelerator.com) in late 2008, 2015 will be the first year since then that I do not consider myself a full-time developer evangelist. I'll continue serving [Twilio's](https://www.twilio.com) developer community in a different capacity, but I am actively scaling back my activities as an evangelist.

I feel pretty confident saying that for a software developer, there is no role quite like developer evangelism. I feel I have grown more professionally in the last several years than I could have in any other job. More importantly, I feel like I have (in fits and starts) been able to impact more people positively than I would have otherwise. Being an evangelist has, without doubt, changed my professional life for the better.

I claim expert knowledge in no field of human endeavor, least of all developer evangelism. However, for whatever it may be worth, I thought I would share some of my observations on what has worked (and not worked) for me personally as a developer evangelist in the last few years. With any luck, it will help any new or future developer evangelists decide for themselves what to do with their precious time in this job.

## Geez, This Looks Long...

You're right, and I understand we're all busy. If you're in search of a brief takeaway for this post, then allow me to suggest the following advice for the current or future evangelist:

* **Serve developers, not yourself or your narrow interests.**
* **Be present with every developer you meet.** 
* **Give what you have to give.**

Lord knows I haven't taken my own advice every day on the job. When I look back though, my successes (both personal and professional) were correlated to how closely I followed these words. If you're interested in a bit more color, I'd be thrilled to have you read on.

## A Framework For What Works In Evangelism

If you're hoping for a tactical breakdown of what do do as an evangelist (which events to attend or what kind of content to write) I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. What tactics will work best for you as an evangelist will vary wildly based on the community you serve. What I will focus on instead is a framework for making decisions about how you spend your time as a developer evangelist.

As I look back on the last six years, the best things I did happened because I was able to focus on these three things. Conversely, the worst failures I had were as a result of not remembering these things. To save you some scrolling, those three bits of advice were:

* **Serve developers, not yourself or your narrow interests.**
* **Be present with every developer you meet.**
* **Give what you have to give.**

Sounds like some Successory nonsense to me too, but those are the most important principles I could think of to guide behavior as a developer evangelist. Let's dive further into these ideas to understand what each actually means.

### Serve developers, not yourself or your narrow interests

Developer evangelists exist because a company needs to create awareness of a product or service among software developers. While this is an inescapable business reality, developer evangelists have the privilege of serving a constituency that is largely unimpressed, perhaps even immune, to direct marketing and salesy crap. So good news! You don't have to be salesy or spammy or pushy, because that stuff doesn't actually work.

The only thing that has worked for me is a technical conversation with another developer, whose problems and experiences I can try to understand. Once in a while, you may notice a pain point that can be alleviated by your product. But nearly every time, you get to have a great conversation and learn more about a person or problem space.

Now, how do you go about having those conversations? Some people might be really good at meeting everyone in a room of people, but that's never been my strength. What I found easier is searching for opportunities to serve developer communities, and to organically increase the number of conversations I have with developers.

<p>At JSConf in 2014, I got to help out at the NodeCopter event. Some people used <a href="https://github.com/kwhinnery/starfox">a little script I wrote</a> to control their drone via input from the HTML 5 gamepad API. So much fun.</p>

Your great opportunity as a developer evangelist is to do full-time what leaders in your community do, without pay, out of the goodness of their hearts. Acting as a servant of your local (or worldwide) developer community not only feels good, it is the most effective way I have seen to meet developers and learn about what they do. When I have allowed myself to "target" developers (in the marketing sense) instead of serve them, I felt worse about the effort and the business results were predictably terrible.

### Be present with every developer you meet

One of the negatives often cited about evangelism is the travel required for the job. Occassionally, you will meet a developer evangelist that is tired and haggard from a multi-city trip. The developer assumes the uncomfortable position of standing between an evangelist and a good night's sleep.

I have certainly been there before. And that was a mistake.

When you're tired and homesick and eating pizza at your third meetup in as many days, you're of no use to anyone. You are doing a disservice to the developers you meet by being only half awake in your conversations with them. A developer's time is precious, and you should be respectful of that.

</div>

This is probably where I have erred most in my career. My natural inclination is to try and find a way to say "yes" to every event and developer gathering I can, to volunteer for every service opportunity I see. Invariably, when I stretch my time too thin, I don't do my best work for the people I am trying to help.

Being "present" means being fully engaged in the place you are, with the people you're with. It's easy to lose that unless you carefully manage your portfolio of community involvement and travel. It's a hard but necessary part of being a developer evangelist. I don't think I ever mastered it, but at moments when I did have that balance and extra energy, I always felt better about what I was doing.

A component of being present is also your motivation - are you at an event to learn and serve? Or are you there to try and sell someone something? Are you giving a talk because it's a hot topic that you think a conference organizer will accept, or because you are genuinely passionate about the subject?  Your motivation will play into your ability to be fully present with your peers.

### Give what you have to give

Everyone has something unqiue to offer. The evangelist role offers you a tremendous amount of flexibility to give whatever bit of experience, expertise, or persepective you have to give. You will enjoy your work and be much more effective if you can successfully focus your unique gifts and interests for the benefit of the greater developer community.

I've been able to do this a few times in my career with some success, and these were some of my very favorite projects to work on. Twilio's developer community lacked a complete, idomatic client library for Node.js. I really like Node, so I decided to [write one](http://twilio.github.io/twilio-node/). I like teaching and mentoring, but I had become frustrated and disillusioned with traditional technical workshops. So I started [something a little crazy](http://quest.twilio.com/).

You won't be able to work on your dream projects every day, of course. But with the wealth of opportunities presented to you in the evangelism role, it's easy to say yes to projects that would be better served by a more passionate and engaged participant. There's no substitute for enthusiasm, and a developer audience can tell when you lack it.

Now I should be careful to say that you shouldn't stay solely in your comfort zone. One of the parts of evangelism I liked most is the opportunity to write Python one day and Objective-C the next. Giving what you have to give might also be the perspective of a beginner.

## Wrapping Up

I have never been super jazzed on the word "evangelist" as a descriptor for the work developers do in this role. I personally find the religious connotations off-putting. I've also observed that for some, the word "evangelist" triggers a sensor that automatically raises bullshit deflector shields at maximum strength. We've tried other words on for size ("advocate" is a popular one), but none seem to describe the role any better.

By any name, I believe a developer evangelist should be a servant of developer communities. Whether you're setting breakpoints in a customer's servlet class, helping a hackathon finalist polish their presentation, or teaching a Ruby workshop to non-programmers, your motivation should be service. You have the opportunity and responsibility to leave your community a little better than you found it.

My implementation of developer evangelism, much like any first draft of a program, could be charitably described as "sub-optimal". But with any luck, you can refactor my experience, rip out the cruft, and release a much improved version of the best job I've ever had.
