Hey everyone, 

Kevin here - I just wanted to take a moment to invite everyone (in the Twin Cities or elsewhere) to join us at [Twilio Signal](http://signal.twilio.com) in May in San Francisco.

There are a lot of conferences out there, and most developers I know have precious little spare time. But if you join us at Signal, I know you will be glad you did. If you'll take a moment to read on, I'll tell you why I feel so confident that is true.

## Amazing Speakers

The speaker lineup at Signal this year is going to be incredible. It doesn't matter which programming language you use or what platform you develop for, [you're going to meet some talented developers and technologists at Signal](http://signal.twilio.com/speakers).

If you're in to DevOps and building systems that can scale, you're in for a treat.

You could be forgiven for thinking this is an exhaustive list, but this is only a modest cross-section of the technical talks you can check out at Signal.  [Check the whole speaker roster (so far!) here](http://signal.twilio.com/speakers).

## Fun! Magic!

Our evening event, [$bash](http://signal.twilio.com/$bash), has been hand crafted by the evangelism and dev community teams for months. It's a carnival for developers, where beating technical (and non-technical) puzzles and challenges will earn you tickets, which you can then turn in for fabulous prizes.

You will also be able to play **my favorite multiplayer video game of all time**, and I am including Goldeneye on Nintendo 64 in that calculation. You'll need to come to Signal to see what I'm talking about - be warned that you won't be able to play it anywhere else.

And yes, there will be actual magic, from Twilio hacker [Doug McKenzie](http://www.dougmckenzie.com). Doug has blown my mind in person, as well as the minds of hundreds of unsuspecting New Yorkers with his tech powered street magic and low tech sleight of hand. You can watch him mystify Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, and CP3 below:

Signal will close out with a musical performance from [They Might be Giants](https://twitter.com/tmbg), pioneers in using technology to enhance musical experiences. After talking through some of the tech they use, they'll perform live for the Signal developer audience.

## New Twilio Hotness

If you're a Twilio user, you'll want to be on hand for Signal. You'll hear about **new communications technologies and APIs** from the developers that created them. We are incredibly excited to see what developers build with these new technologies. You will also be able to learn from Twilio power users like Zendesk, Uber, Wix, Datalot, Cloudflare, and more about their tech stacks and Twilio integrations.

## Join Us!

I know that it's a significant investment to get yourself to San Francisco, both in dollars and a more precious commodity, your time. But I feel comfortable saying that if you do join us at Signal, you'll be very happy that you did. We've poured a lot of love into this event, which we hope will come through to our fellow developers.

If you made it this far, you also deserve a little prize - if you register with the promo code **Whinnery20**, you'll receive 20% your ticket price. 

Thanks for reading, and I hope you decide to join us at Signal!
